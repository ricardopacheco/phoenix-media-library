This is an Elixir library for associating media files with Ecto schemas. Originally inspired by Spatie's Laravel Media Library, the storage architecture follows a JSONB-embedded approach inspired by [Shrine](https://shrinerb.com/).

## Project overview

PhxMediaLibrary provides a simple, fluent API for:
- Associating files with Ecto schemas
- Organizing media into collections
- Storing files across different storage backends
- Generating derived images (thumbnails, conversions)
- Handling file uploads

## Project guidelines

- Use `mix precommit` alias when you are done with all changes and fix any pending issues
- Use `:req` (`Req`) library for HTTP requests (e.g., downloading remote files), **avoid** `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, and `:httpc`
- This is a **library**, not an application - design APIs to be flexible and composable
- Follow semantic versioning for releases

### Library design principles

- **Provide sensible defaults** but allow configuration at every level
- **Avoid global configuration** where possible - prefer passing options explicitly or using schema-level configuration
- **Use behaviours** for extensibility (storage adapters, image processors, etc.)
- **Keep dependencies minimal** - make heavy dependencies optional where feasible
- **Write comprehensive documentation** - every public function needs `@doc` and `@spec`
- **Design fluent APIs** that are pleasant to use:

      post
      |> PhxMediaLibrary.add(upload)
      |> PhxMediaLibrary.with_custom_properties(%{"alt" => "Sunset"})
      |> PhxMediaLibrary.to_collection(:images)

### Documentation guidelines

- **Always** write `@moduledoc` for every module explaining its purpose
- **Always** write `@doc` for every public function with examples
- **Always** write `@spec` typespecs for all public functions
- Use `@typedoc` for custom types
- Include usage examples in module docs that can be run as doctests
- Structure documentation to be readable on HexDocs

### Hex publishing guidelines

- Keep `mix.exs` metadata complete: `:description`, `:package`, `:source_url`, `:docs`
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` with all notable changes
- **Never** publish with failing tests or missing documentation
- Use `mix hex.build --unpack` to verify package contents before publishing

## Elixir guidelines

- Elixir lists **do not support index based access via the access syntax**

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      mylist[i]

  Instead, **always** use `Enum.at`, pattern matching, or `List` for index based list access, ie:

      i = 0
      mylist = ["blue", "green"]
      Enum.at(mylist, i)

- Elixir variables are immutable, but can be rebound, so for block expressions like `if`, `case`, `cond`, etc
  you *must* bind the result of the expression to a variable if you want to use it and you CANNOT rebind the result inside the expression, ie:

      # INVALID: we are rebinding inside the `if` and the result never gets assigned
      if connected?(socket) do
        socket = assign(socket, :val, val)
      end

      # VALID: we rebind the result of the `if` to a new variable
      socket =
        if connected?(socket) do
          assign(socket, :val, val)
        end

- **Never** nest multiple modules in the same file as it can cause cyclic dependencies and compilation errors
- **Never** use map access syntax (`changeset[:field]`) on structs as they do not implement the Access behaviour by default. For regular structs, you **must** access the fields directly, such as `my_struct.field` or use higher level APIs that are available on the struct if they exist, `Ecto.Changeset.get_field/2` for changesets
- Elixir's standard library has everything necessary for date and time manipulation. Familiarize yourself with the common `Time`, `Date`, `DateTime`, and `Calendar` interfaces by accessing their documentation as necessary. **Never** install additional dependencies unless asked or for date/time parsing (which you can use the `date_time_parser` package)
- Don't use `String.to_atom/1` on user input (memory leak risk)
- Predicate function names should not start with `is_` and should end in a question mark. Names like `is_thing` should be reserved for guards
- Elixir's builtin OTP primitives like `DynamicSupervisor` and `Registry`, require names in the child spec, such as `{DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.MyDynamicSup}`, then you can use `DynamicSupervisor.start_child(MyApp.MyDynamicSup, child_spec)`
- Use `Task.async_stream(collection, callback, options)` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure. The majority of times you will want to pass `timeout: :infinity` as option

### Behaviours and protocols

- **Use behaviours** for defining contracts (storage adapters, processors)
- **Use protocols** when you need polymorphism across different data types
- **Always** provide a default implementation or clear error messages for required callbacks
- Document all callbacks with `@doc` and `@callback` specs

### Error handling

- **Return tagged tuples** (`{:ok, result}` / `{:error, reason}`) for operations that can fail
- Provide `!` bang versions for functions where appropriate (e.g., `add_media!/2`)
- Use custom exception structs for domain-specific errors
- **Never** raise exceptions for expected failure cases (e.g., file not found, invalid format)

## Mix guidelines

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason
- Use `mix docs` to preview documentation locally before publishing
- Run `mix dialyzer` to catch type errors (if dialyxir is configured)

## Test guidelines

- **Always use `start_supervised!/1`** to start processes in tests as it guarantees cleanup between tests
- **Avoid** `Process.sleep/1` and `Process.alive?/1` in tests
  - Instead of sleeping to wait for a process to finish, **always** use `Process.monitor/1` and assert on the DOWN message:

      ref = Process.monitor(pid)
      assert_receive {:DOWN, ^ref, :process, ^pid, :normal}

  - Instead of sleeping to synchronize before the next call, **always** use `_ = :sys.get_state/1` to ensure the process has handled prior messages

### Library-specific testing

- **Test with real files** in a temporary directory that gets cleaned up after each test
- Use `tmp_dir` ExUnit tag or create fixtures in `test/support/fixtures/`
- **Test all storage adapters** with the same test suite using adapter-agnostic assertions
- Write integration tests that verify the full flow (add media → store → retrieve → convert)
- Use mocks sparingly - prefer testing against real implementations or in-memory adapters
- **Always** test error conditions and edge cases (missing files, invalid formats, storage failures)

## Ecto guidelines

- `Ecto.Schema` fields always use the `:string` type, even for `:text` columns, ie: `field :name, :string`
- `Ecto.Changeset.validate_number/2` **DOES NOT SUPPORT the `:allow_nil` option**. By default, Ecto validations only run if a change for the given field exists and the change value is not nil, so such an option is never needed
- You **must** use `Ecto.Changeset.get_field(changeset, :field)` to access changeset fields
- Fields which are set programmatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct
- **Always** invoke `mix ecto.gen.migration migration_name_using_underscores` when generating migration files, so the correct timestamp and conventions are applied

### Media library Ecto patterns — JSONB-embedded storage (Shrine-inspired)

The library uses a **JSONB column approach** inspired by [Shrine](https://shrinerb.com/) instead of a
separate polymorphic `media` table. Each schema that needs media stores its own media data in a JSONB
column, eliminating JOINs and improving read performance.

#### Core principles

- **No separate `media` table** — media data lives inside the schema that owns it (e.g., `posts.media_data`)
- **Column name is configurable per schema** — defaults to `media_data`, but each schema can choose its own column name via the `use PhxMediaLibrary.HasMedia` options
- **Collections are top-level keys** in the JSONB — each collection (`:images`, `:avatar`, `:documents`) is a key in the JSON object, holding an array of media items
- **Soft deletes are at the parent record level** — when the parent record (e.g., a Post) is soft-deleted (`deleted_at` set), the JSONB with all media data stays intact. Physical files in storage are only removed when the parent record is **hard-deleted** (removed from the database)
- **Conversion status is tracked within each media item** — the `generated_conversions` map inside each JSONB media entry tracks which conversions have been processed, following the same pattern as before

#### JSONB structure

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "uuid": "a1b2c3d4",
      "name": "photo",
      "file_name": "photo.jpg",
      "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
      "disk": "local",
      "size": 123456,
      "checksum": "e3b0c44298fc1c14...",
      "checksum_algorithm": "sha256",
      "order": 0,
      "custom_properties": {},
      "metadata": {"width": 1920, "height": 1080},
      "generated_conversions": {"thumb": true, "preview": true},
      "responsive_images": {
        "original": {"variants": [{"width": 320, "path": "..."}], "placeholder": {"data_uri": "..."}}
      },
      "inserted_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "avatar": [...],
  "documents": [...]
}
```

#### Key differences from polymorphic table approach

- **No `mediable_type` / `mediable_id`** — ownership is implicit (the JSONB lives inside the owning record)
- **Reads are faster** — no JOIN needed, a single query to `posts` returns everything including media
- **Writes to individual media items are more complex** — updating a single item (e.g., marking a conversion as done) requires `jsonb_set` or reading/modifying/writing the whole JSONB
- **Querying across models** (e.g., "all images of type jpeg across all posts") uses GIN indexes on the JSONB column, which is acceptable but less performant than dedicated indexed columns

#### Schema integration

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post do
  use Ecto.Schema
  use PhxMediaLibrary.HasMedia, column: :media_data  # configurable column name

  schema "posts" do
    field :title, :string
    field :media_data, :map, default: %{}  # JSONB column

    timestamps()
  end

  media_collections do
    collection :images, max_files: 20 do
      convert :thumb, width: 150, height: 150, fit: :cover
      convert :preview, width: 800
    end

    collection :avatar, single_file: true do
      convert :thumb, width: 150, height: 150
    end
  end
end
```

#### Migration pattern

Users add a JSONB column to their own tables instead of creating a separate `media` table:

```elixir
alter table(:posts) do
  add :media_data, :map, default: %{}, null: false
end

# Optional: GIN index for querying within the JSONB
create index(:posts, [:media_data], using: "GIN")
```

## File and storage guidelines

- **Abstract storage behind behaviours** - support local filesystem, S3, GCS, etc.
- **Never** trust user-provided filenames - sanitize and/or generate safe names
- Store files with **unique names** (UUIDs or hashes) to avoid collisions
- Preserve original filename in database metadata, not in the stored path
- **Calculate and store checksums** (MD5/SHA256) for integrity verification
- Support **streaming uploads** for large files to avoid memory issues
- Handle **mime type detection** properly - don't rely solely on file extensions

### Path conventions

- Use a consistent, predictable path structure: `{owner_type}/{owner_id}/{uuid}/{filename}`
- Make paths configurable but provide sensible defaults
- Support both public and private file URLs
- Generate **signed/expiring URLs** for private storage backends

## Image processing guidelines

- **Make image processing optional** - don't require ImageMagick/libvips for basic usage
- Support multiple processing backends via behaviours (Image, Mogrify, Vix, etc.)
- Define conversions declaratively in the schema:

      conversions do
        convert :thumb, width: 100, height: 100, fit: :cover
        convert :preview, width: 800, quality: 85
      end

- Process conversions **asynchronously** by default (via Oban or similar)
- Store conversion status to track processing state
- Support **responsive images** (multiple sizes/srcset generation)
- Handle processing failures gracefully with retries and error reporting
