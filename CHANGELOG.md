> ## ⚠️ Fork notice
>
> This is a fork of [mike-kostov/phx_media_library](https://github.com/mike-kostov/phx_media_library).
> Diverged from upstream `v0.5.1` (commit `526e22a`) to replace the polymorphic
> `media` table with **embedded JSONB columns on each parent schema** for
> better performance and a simpler operational model.
>
> ### Storage model in this fork
>
> - Each parent schema declares `field :media_data, :map` (or a custom column
>   via `use HasMedia, column: :foo`). All media items for a parent live in
>   that single JSONB document, keyed by collection name → array of items.
> - **`PhxMediaLibrary.MediaItem`** is the persistence struct stored inside
>   the JSONB array. Fields: `:uuid`, `:name`, `:file_name`, `:mime_type`,
>   `:disk`, `:size`, `:checksum`, `:order`, `:custom_properties`,
>   `:metadata`, `:generated_conversions`, `:responsive_images`,
>   `:inserted_at`. Plus virtual `:collection_name`, `:owner_type`,
>   `:owner_id` populated at read time (the parent's table name and id are
>   the source of truth — never stored in JSONB).
> - **`PhxMediaLibrary.MediaData`** holds pure functions over the JSONB map:
>   `get_collection/3`, `put_item/3`, `update_item/4`, `remove_item/4`,
>   `reorder/3`, `all_items/2`, `count/2`. They take and return plain maps.
> - **`PhxMediaLibrary.Helpers.update_media_data/2`** applies an updater
>   function to a parent model's JSONB column and persists via Ecto.
> - **`PhxMediaLibrary.Media`** is a plain struct (not an Ecto schema) with
>   the same fields as `MediaItem`. Used as a "view" type. Convertible via
>   `Media.from_media_item/1` and `Media.to_media_item/1`.
> - **`MediaAdder`** writes via `MediaData.put_item/3` +
>   `Helpers.update_media_data/2` instead of `Repo.insert(%Media{})`.
> - Path generators accept any struct/map with the required fields (Media,
>   MediaItem, or plain map) — typespecs use `map()` rather than `Media.t()`.
>
> ### Upstream features that are NOT ported
>
> - **Soft deletes.** `delete/1`/`restore/1`/`trashed?/1`/`purge_trashed/2`,
>   `exclude_trashed/1`, `only_trashed/1`, `mix phx_media_library.purge_deleted`
>   are not available. Hard delete only.
> - **Polymorphic `has_many :media` association** injected by `has_media()`.
>   Without a media table, there is nothing to associate. Use
>   `PhxMediaLibrary.get_media/2` to fetch items from JSONB.
> - **`Media.changeset`, `Media.permanently_delete/1`, `Media.for_model/2`.**
>   Use `Helpers.update_media_data/2` + `MediaData.*` to mutate the JSONB.
> - **The `add_deleted_at_to_media` migration** and any reference to a
>   `media` table.
>
> The CHANGELOG below preserves upstream's release history verbatim. Where
> a feature in those entries is in the not-ported list above, assume the
> upstream description does not apply to this fork. Fork-specific changes
> are tracked under [Unreleased — Fork](#unreleased--fork) below.

## [Unreleased — Fork]

Fork-specific changes since branching from upstream `v0.5.1`. Track this
section for what actually shipped in this repository.

### v0.6.0 upstream sync (5 commits)

Cherry-picked from upstream `v0.6.0` and adapted to JSONB:

- **Wave 1 (`71e6466`)** — `PathGenerator` becomes a behaviour with
  delegating functions, plus built-in `Default` / `Flat` / `DateBased`
  generators. Optional 3-arity callbacks for `path_context`. New
  `Config.path_generator/0`. `mix doctor` and `mix stats` were initially
  stubbed (see the post-sync section).
- **Docker test infra (`57c3ec5`)** — Postgres service for the test
  database via `docker compose up -d postgres`.
- **Wave 2 (`ec5fc62`)** — FFmpeg video processor (`Config.video_processor/0`,
  `VideoProcessor.FFmpeg`/`Null`), `PathGenerator.Tenant` for tenant-scoped
  paths via `path_context`, multi-tenant guide, automatic poster-frame
  extraction for video uploads. The `responsive_images` JSONB shape was
  extended to also store posters as
  `%{"poster" => %{"path" => ..., "url" => ...}}`.
- **S3 multipart fix (`d6d7f3f`)** — rechunk streaming uploads to 5 MiB
  parts to satisfy S3's multipart minimum.
- **Wave 3 (`670dd53`)** — Blurhash placeholders, CDN URLs with cache-bust
  fingerprint, download URLs (`Content-Disposition: attachment`), signed
  URLs (S3 presigned + local HMAC), `Plug.MediaDownload`. New top-level
  API: `cdn_url/2`, `download_url/3`, `signed_url/3`, `blurhash/1`.

### Post-sync

- **`mix phx_media_library.doctor` and `mix phx_media_library.stats`
  reimplemented for JSONB** (`e6d2bfa`):
  - New `ModelRegistry.all_models/0` with deterministic discovery: explicit
    `:model_registry` config takes precedence; otherwise scan loaded modules
    that export `__media_type__/0`.
  - `mix stats` aggregates counts and sizes at the database level using
    PostgreSQL `jsonb_each` + `jsonb_array_elements` (one query per schema).
  - `mix doctor` walks every HasMedia schema's JSONB and verifies file
    existence + conversion files. The orphan and soft-delete checks from
    upstream were dropped — they don't apply to embedded JSONB.
- **`Components.ex` audit** (`dd0e229`) — fixed `blurhash/1` using
  `@media.id` (KeyError on `MediaItem`); now uses `@media.uuid`. Added
  `render_component/2` tests for `blurhash/1` and `media_video/1` against
  `MediaItem` structs.
- **`Storage.S3` to 100% coverage with real RustFS** (`7dd7012`) — added a
  RustFS service to `docker-compose.yml` and wrote 26 tests against real
  S3-compatible storage. Surfaced a **critical bug** in upstream's
  `rechunk/2` (introduced by `a9cf1e4`): `Stream.transform/4`'s `last_fun`
  emissions are silently dropped in Elixir 1.19, causing the final partial
  part of every multipart upload to be lost. Fixed via a sentinel-based
  `Stream.transform/3` rewrite that flushes the leftover buffer in-band.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

#### 4.1 — BlurHash Generation

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.Blurhash`** — new module that generates BlurHash strings
  from image files. Uses the `:image` library (libvips) to resize images to a
  small working size and applies a pure-Elixir DCT encoder (base-83 alphabet,
  reference: blurha.sh). Optional — silently disabled when `:image` is not
  installed.

- **`Config.blurhash_enabled?/0`** — returns `true` when
  `responsive_images: [blurhash: true]` is configured **and** the `:image`
  library is available.

- **Automatic blurhash generation** — `MediaAdder` now generates a BlurHash
  string for every image upload when `blurhash_enabled?/0` is true. The hash
  is stored in `media.responsive_images["blurhash"]`.

- **`Media.blurhash/1`** and **`PhxMediaLibrary.blurhash/1`** — convenience
  helpers that return `media.responsive_images["blurhash"]` or `nil`.

- **`<PhxMediaLibrary.Components.blurhash>`** — new function component that
  renders the hash as a `<canvas>` element. A colocated JavaScript hook
  (no npm dependency) decodes the hash client-side and paints the blurred
  preview, providing smooth progressive loading before the real image arrives.

#### 4.4a — CDN URL Generation with Cache-Busting

- **`url/3` `:cache_bust` option** — pass `cache_bust: true` to any
  URL-generating call to append `?v={checksum[0..7]}` to the URL. The
  fingerprint comes from the media item's stored SHA-256 checksum, so CDN
  edges automatically serve a fresh copy whenever a file is replaced. Falls
  back to a plain URL when no checksum is stored.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.cdn_url/2`**, **`Media.cdn_url/2`**, and
  **`UrlGenerator.cdn_url/2`** — convenience shorthand for
  `url(media, conversion, cache_bust: true)`.

#### 4.4b — Content-Disposition Download Links

- **`url/3` `:download` option** — pass `download: true` to generate a URL
  that triggers `Content-Disposition: attachment` in the browser.

  - **S3**: generates a presigned GET URL with the
    `response-content-disposition` query parameter included in the AWS
    Signature V4 canonical request (so the signature is valid).
  - **Local disk**: routes through `PhxMediaLibrary.Plug.MediaDownload`
    which serves the file with the proper response header.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.download_url/3`**, **`Media.download_url/3`**, and
  **`UrlGenerator.download_url/3`** — shorthand for
  `url(media, conversion, download: true)`.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.Plug.MediaDownload`** — new Plug for local-disk
  storage. Mount it in the Phoenix router at the path configured as
  `download_base_url`. Supports unsigned download links and HMAC-signed
  expiring URLs (see 4.4c below). Includes path-traversal protection.

#### 4.4c — Signed / Expiring URLs

- **`url/3` `:signed` and `:expires_in` options** — pass `signed: true` to
  generate a time-limited URL. `:expires_in` controls the expiry window in
  seconds (default: `3600`).

  - **S3**: AWS Signature V4 presigned GET URL (already supported internally;
    now cleanly exposed through the unified `url/3` API).
  - **Local disk**: HMAC-SHA256–signed URL verified by
    `PhxMediaLibrary.Plug.MediaDownload`. Requires `secret_key_base` and
    `download_base_url` in the disk config.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.signed_url/3`**, **`Media.signed_url/3`**, and
  **`UrlGenerator.signed_url/3`** — shorthand for
  `url(media, conversion, signed: true)`.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.SignedUrl`** — new module implementing HMAC-SHA256
  signing and constant-time verification for local-disk URLs.

- **`Config.secret_key_base/0`** and **`Config.download_base_url/0`** —
  new config helpers for the global signing secret and download plug mount
  path.

#### 4.3 — Multi-Tenant Support

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.PathGenerator.Tenant`** — new built-in path generator
  that prepends a `tenant_id` segment to every storage path:
  `{tenant_id}/{mediable_type}/{mediable_id}/{uuid}/{filename}`. The
  `tenant_id` is read from the optional `path_context` map (atom or string
  key); falls back to `"shared"` when absent. Integer IDs are coerced to
  strings automatically.

- **Multi-Tenant guide** (`guides/multi-tenant.md`) — covers natural
  per-model scoping, configuring `PathGenerator.Tenant`, passing
  `path_context` through upload flows, cross-model queries, per-tenant
  storage backends, custom generators, and migrating existing files.

- **`Config.path_generator/0` doc** updated to list `Tenant` alongside
  `Default`, `Flat`, and `DateBased`.

#### 4.2 — Optional FFmpeg Video Processor

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.VideoProcessor` behaviour** — new pluggable behaviour
  for video processing adapters with three callbacks: `available?/0`,
  `extract_metadata/1`, and `extract_poster/2`.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.VideoProcessor.FFmpeg`** — implementation using
  `ffprobe` (metadata) and `ffmpeg` (poster frames). Selected automatically
  when both executables are found on `$PATH`. No configuration required.
  Extracts: `duration` (float seconds), `width`, `height`, `codec`, `fps`,
  `audio_codec`, `bit_rate`.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.VideoProcessor.Null`** — no-op fallback used when
  FFmpeg is not installed. Uploads still succeed; metadata and poster
  generation are simply skipped without errors.

- **`Config.video_processor/0`** — returns the active video processor
  module; auto-detects FFmpeg at startup; configurable via
  `config :phx_media_library, video_processor: …`

- **Automatic video metadata extraction** — `MetadataExtractor.Default`
  now delegates video file extraction to the configured `VideoProcessor`,
  populating `media.metadata` with duration, dimensions, codec, and fps on
  every video upload when FFmpeg is available.

- **Poster frame generation** — `MediaAdder` extracts a JPEG poster frame
  at 10% into the video (capped at 5 s) immediately after upload and stores
  it alongside the video file. The URL is recorded in
  `media.responsive_images["poster"]["url"]` for use in templates.

- **`<.media_video>` component** — new `PhxMediaLibrary.Components`
  function component that renders a styled `<video>` player with automatic
  poster frame, preload, and a metadata strip (duration, dimensions, codec,
  fps). Accepts `controls`, `autoplay`, `muted`, `loop`, and `class`
  attributes.

### Fixed

- **`delete_files/1` crash on media with responsive images** — the
  responsive images delete loop incorrectly pattern-matched
  `%{"path" => path}` directly on top-level map values, which are actually
  `%{"variants" => [...], "placeholder" => ...}` structs. The loop now
  uses multi-clause `Enum.each` to correctly handle both responsive image
  variant lists and poster frame entries (`%{"path" => ..., "url" => ...}`).

- **`data-confirm` interpolation in gallery_app video delete button** —
  the confirmation string used unescaped curly quotes around the filename,
  causing a HEEx compile warning. Now uses proper `\"` escaping.

### Changed

- **Version bumped to `0.6.0`** — covers the full Milestone 4 feature set
  (4.2 FFmpeg video processing, 4.3 multi-tenant path generator, 4.4/4.5/4.6
  tooling and path generators delivered in Wave 1).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Nested `collection ... do` DSL for conversions** — you can now nest `convert` calls inside a `collection ... do ... end` block within `media_collections`. Each conversion is automatically scoped to the enclosing collection — no need to pass `:collections` manually. This is now the recommended style:

  ```elixir
  media_collections do
    collection :images, max_files: 20 do
      convert :thumb, width: 150, height: 150, fit: :cover
      convert :preview, width: 800, quality: 85
    end

    collection :documents, accepts: ~w(application/pdf)

    collection :avatar, single_file: true do
      convert :thumb, width: 150, height: 150, fit: :cover
    end
  end
  ```

  The nested and flat styles can be mixed freely. Explicit `:collections` options inside nested blocks are respected. See the updated [Collections & Conversions](guides/collections-and-conversions.md) guide for details.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.ModelRegistry`** — new always-compiled module that discovers and caches the Ecto schema module for a given `mediable_type` string. Previously this logic lived inside `PhxMediaLibrary.Workers.ProcessConversions` (which is only compiled when Oban is installed), causing warnings in the `mix phx_media_library.regenerate` task for projects without Oban. Both the Oban worker and the mix task now delegate to `ModelRegistry`.

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.MediaLive` LiveComponent** — a self-contained LiveComponent that encapsulates the entire media upload + gallery lifecycle. Eliminates all upload boilerplate: no `use PhxMediaLibrary.LiveUpload`, no `handle_event` clauses, no `allow_upload`, no `consume_media`. Just drop it into any LiveView template:

  ```elixir
  <.live_component
    module={PhxMediaLibrary.MediaLive}
    id="post-images"
    model={@post}
    collection={:images}
  />
  ```

  Features: drag-and-drop upload zone, live image previews, progress bars, error display, cancel buttons, submit button, stream-powered media gallery with delete-on-hover, dark mode support. Configurable via `max_file_size`, `max_entries`, `responsive`, `upload_label`, `upload_sublabel`, `compact`, `columns`, `conversion`, `show_gallery`, and `class` options.

  Sends `{PhxMediaLibrary.MediaLive, {:uploaded, collection, media_items}}` and `{PhxMediaLibrary.MediaLive, {:deleted, collection, media}}` messages to the parent LiveView for optional reaction.

- **Restructured LiveView guide** — now leads with the zero-boilerplate `MediaLive` LiveComponent approach, with a dedicated "Custom Upload UI" section documenting how to build your own form with `<.live_file_input>` for full control. Includes a clear warning about the nested form gotcha with `<.media_upload>`.

- **`upload_class`, `gallery_class`, `button_class` options for `MediaLive`** — allows consumers to override the default Tailwind utility classes on the drop zone wrapper, gallery grid container, and submit button respectively. When `nil` (default), the built-in styles are used. When set, the value replaces the default classes entirely, enabling seamless integration with component libraries like daisyUI (e.g. `button_class="btn btn-primary w-full"`).

### Fixed

- **Eliminated noisy ExAws/S3 compile warnings in consumer projects** — `PhxMediaLibrary.Storage.S3` is now wrapped in `if Code.ensure_loaded?(ExAws.S3) do`, matching the pattern already used by `ImageProcessor.Image` and `AsyncProcessor.Oban`. Consumer projects that don't use S3 will no longer see ~15 `ExAws.S3.* is undefined` warnings during compilation.

- **Eliminated `ProcessConversions.find_model_module/1 is undefined` warning** — the `mix phx_media_library.regenerate` task previously referenced `PhxMediaLibrary.Workers.ProcessConversions` which only exists when Oban is installed. The model lookup logic has been extracted into `PhxMediaLibrary.ModelRegistry` (always compiled), and the Oban worker now delegates to it. `ProcessConversions.find_model_module/1` remains as a `defdelegate` for backwards compatibility.

- **Multi-file selection now works by default** — non-`single_file` collections without an explicit `max_files` now default to `max_entries: 10`, enabling the `multiple` attribute on the file input. Previously, `max_entries` was left unset, which caused Phoenix LiveView to default to 1 (single file picker). Collections with `single_file: true` still correctly limit to 1, and `max_files: N` still maps to `max_entries: N`.

- **Upload progress bars are now visible on fast/local uploads** — the progress bar track is rendered as soon as a file is selected (`progress >= 0`) instead of only when `progress > 0`. On local development, uploads complete almost instantly so the previous `> 0 && < 100` condition meant the bar was never visible. The bar now shows a subtle track at 0%, fills with blue as progress advances, displays a percentage label, and transitions to a "Ready" checkmark at 100%.

### Changed

- **Updated all documentation to recommend nested DSL** — the `HasMedia` moduledoc, getting-started guide, and collections-and-conversions guide now show the nested `collection ... do convert ... end` style as the primary/recommended approach, with the flat style and function-based approach as alternatives. All examples explicitly scope conversions to collections.

- **LiveView guide — "How Upload Limits Are Derived" section** — documents how `max_entries` is automatically derived from collection configuration (`single_file: true` → 1, `max_files: N` → N, otherwise 10) and how the `max_entries` component option overrides it.

- **LiveView guide — "Customizing Styles" section** — documents the `upload_class`, `gallery_class`, and `button_class` options with examples for daisyUI integration and fully custom styling.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Milestone 3c complete** (717 tests passing: up from 653 in v0.4.0)

#### 3.5 — Soft Deletes

- **Opt-in soft deletes** — `config :phx_media_library, soft_deletes: true` enables soft deletes globally. Disabled by default — no behaviour change for existing users
- **`delete/1` respects config** — When soft deletes are enabled, `delete/1` sets `deleted_at` instead of removing the record and files. When disabled, behaviour is unchanged (hard delete)
- **`permanently_delete/1`** — Always performs a hard delete (removes files from storage and database record) regardless of the soft deletes configuration
- **`soft_delete/1`** — Explicitly soft-delete a media item by setting its `deleted_at` timestamp. Files are preserved in storage until `permanently_delete/1` or `purge_trashed/2` is called
- **`restore/1`** — Restore a soft-deleted media item by clearing `deleted_at`
- **`trashed?/1`** — Predicate to check whether a media item has been soft-deleted
- **`get_trashed_media/2`** — Query only soft-deleted media for a model, optionally filtered by collection (inverse of `get_media/2`)
- **`purge_trashed/2`** — Permanently delete all trashed media for a model, with optional `:before` cutoff for age-based cleanup (e.g. `before: DateTime.add(DateTime.utc_now(), -30, :day)`)
- **Query scoping** — `get_media/2`, `get_first_media/2`, `media_query/2`, and `Media.for_model/2` automatically exclude soft-deleted records when soft deletes are enabled
- **`exclude_trashed/1`** and **`only_trashed/1`** — Query helpers on `Media` for composing custom Ecto queries
- **`clear_collection/2` and `clear_media/1` respect soft deletes** — When enabled, these set `deleted_at` via `update_all` instead of deleting records. Files are preserved until purge
- **`mix phx_media_library.purge_deleted`** — Mix task to permanently remove old soft-deleted media. Options: `--days N` (default: 30), `--all`, `--dry-run`, `--yes`
- **New migration** — `add_deleted_at_to_media` adds `deleted_at` column with index
- **Install task updated** — `mix phx_media_library.install` now includes `deleted_at` column and index from the start

#### 3.6 — Streaming Upload Support

- **File streaming** — `MediaAdder` no longer loads entire files into memory via `File.read!`. Files are streamed to storage in 64 KB chunks using `File.stream!/2`
- **Single-pass checksum** — SHA-256 checksum is computed during the stream (via `Stream.map/2` feeding `:crypto.hash_update/2`) instead of a separate full-file read
- **Header-only MIME detection** — Only the first 512 bytes are read for magic-byte MIME type detection, sufficient for all supported formats (including TAR at offset 257)
- **Known issue resolved** — "MediaAdder loads entire file into memory" is no longer applicable

#### 3.7 — Direct S3 Upload (Presigned URLs)

- **`presigned_upload_url/3`** — Generate a presigned URL for direct client-to-S3 uploads. Returns `{:ok, url, fields, upload_key}`. Requires `:filename` option; supports `:content_type`, `:expires_in`, `:max_size`
- **`complete_external_upload/4`** — Create a `Media` database record after the client uploads directly to storage. Requires `:filename`, `:content_type`, `:size`; supports `:custom_properties`, `:checksum`, `:checksum_algorithm`
- **`presigned_upload_url/3` callback** — New optional callback on `PhxMediaLibrary.Storage` behaviour. S3 adapter implements it; Disk and Memory adapters return `{:error, :not_supported}`
- **`StorageWrapper.presigned_upload_url/3`** — Adapter-aware wrapper that checks `function_exported?/3` and returns `{:error, :not_supported}` for adapters without the callback
- **Telemetry** — `complete_external_upload/4` emits `[:phx_media_library, :add, :start | :stop]` events with `source_type: :external`

### Changed

- **`MediaAdder.store_and_persist/6` → `store_and_persist/5`** — No longer receives `file_content` as a parameter. Checksum is computed during streaming
- **`MediaAdder.read_and_detect_mime/1`** — Now reads only the first 512 bytes (header) instead of the entire file. Returns `{:ok, file_info, header}` instead of `{:ok, file_info, file_content}`
- **`Media.delete/1` return type** — Returns `{:ok, media}` when soft deletes are enabled (soft delete), or `:ok` when disabled (hard delete)
- **`Media` schema** — Added `deleted_at` field (`:utc_datetime`, default `nil`)
- **`Media.permanently_delete/1`** — Renamed from the previous `delete/1` hard-delete implementation. `delete/1` now dispatches based on soft deletes config
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.Storage` behaviour** — Added optional `presigned_upload_url/3` callback
- **Install task migration template** — Now includes `deleted_at` column and index

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Milestone 3b complete** (653 tests passing: up from 529 in v0.3.0)

#### 3b.1 — Remote URL Sources (Enhanced)

- **URL validation** — `add_from_url/3` now validates URL scheme (only `http`/`https` allowed), rejects missing hosts, and returns descriptive `{:error, {:invalid_url, reason}}` tuples for `ftp://`, `file://`, or malformed URLs
- **Custom request headers** — `add_from_url/3` accepts `:headers` option for authenticated downloads (e.g. `headers: [{"Authorization", "Bearer token"}]`)
- **Download timeout** — `:timeout` option sets a receive timeout for slow servers
- **Download telemetry** — New `[:phx_media_library, :download, :start | :stop | :exception]` events with URL, size, and MIME type metadata
- **Source URL tracking** — When media is added from a URL, the original URL is automatically stored in `custom_properties["source_url"]`
- **Broader success codes** — Downloads now accept any 2xx status code (200–299), not just 200

#### 3b.2 — Automatic Metadata Extraction

- **`PhxMediaLibrary.MetadataExtractor`** — New behaviour for extracting file metadata with `extract/3` callback
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.MetadataExtractor.Default`** — Default implementation that:
  - Extracts image dimensions (`width`, `height`), alpha channel presence, and EXIF data via the `:image` library (when available)
  - Classifies files into type categories: `"image"`, `"video"`, `"audio"`, `"document"`, `"other"`
  - Normalizes MIME subtypes to human-friendly format names (e.g. `"quicktime"` → `"mov"`, `"svg+xml"` → `"svg"`)
  - Sanitizes EXIF data for JSON serialization (handles binaries, tuples, atoms)
  - Gracefully falls back when `:image` is not installed — no crash, just base metadata
- **`metadata` field on `Media` schema** — New `:map` field (default `%{}`) storing extracted metadata; persisted as a JSON column
- **New migration** — `add_metadata_to_media` migration adds the `metadata` column
- **Install task updated** — `mix phx_media_library.install` now generates migrations with `metadata`, `checksum`, and `checksum_algorithm` columns included from the start
- **Auto-extraction in pipeline** — `to_collection/3` automatically extracts metadata after MIME detection and before storage
- **`without_metadata/1`** — New builder function to skip extraction for a specific upload: `PhxMediaLibrary.without_metadata(adder)`
- **Global disable** — `config :phx_media_library, extract_metadata: false` disables extraction globally
- **Custom extractor** — `config :phx_media_library, metadata_extractor: MyApp.MetadataExtractor` to use your own implementation
- **Non-fatal extraction** — Extraction failures are logged as warnings but never block the upload; media is stored with an empty metadata map
- **Timestamp tracking** — Extracted metadata includes `"extracted_at"` ISO 8601 timestamp

#### 3b.3 — Oban Conversion Queuing (Enhanced)

- **`process_sync/2`** — Added synchronous processing callback to `PhxMediaLibrary.AsyncProcessor.Oban`, delegating to `Conversions.process/2` for immediate conversions without queueing
- **Enhanced documentation** — Oban adapter now documents full setup flow (deps, queue config, PhxMediaLibrary config), queue sizing guidance, and retry behaviour (max 3 attempts with exponential backoff)

### Changed

- **`MediaAdder` struct** — Added `:extract_metadata` field (default: `true` from `MetadataExtractor.enabled?/0`)
- **`MediaAdder.to_collection/3`** — Pipeline now includes metadata extraction step between content-type verification and storage
- **`store_and_persist/6`** — Accepts metadata map parameter and includes it in media attributes
- **`resolve_source/1`** — Now handles `{:url, url, opts}` three-element tuple for URL sources with options
- **`source_type/1`** — Handles `{:url, _, _}` pattern for URL sources with options
- **`Media` schema** — Added `metadata` field to `@optional_fields` in changeset

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Milestone 3a complete** (529 tests passing: 325 unit + 17 Oban worker + 28 new M3a + 159 integration)
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.Error`** — Base exception struct with `:message`, `:reason`, and `:metadata` fields. Used by `to_collection!/3` and other bang functions
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.StorageError`** — Exception for storage operation failures with `:operation`, `:path`, `:adapter`, and `:reason` fields. Auto-generates descriptive messages from context
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.ValidationError`** — Exception for pre-storage validation failures with `:field`, `:value`, and `:constraint` fields. Human-readable default messages for `:file_too_large`, `:invalid_mime_type`, and `:content_type_mismatch` reasons with automatic byte formatting (bytes/KB/MB)
- **Telemetry integration** — `PhxMediaLibrary.Telemetry` module emitting `:telemetry.span/3` events for all key operations:
  - `[:phx_media_library, :add, :start | :stop | :exception]` — media addition lifecycle
  - `[:phx_media_library, :delete, :start | :stop | :exception]` — media deletion lifecycle
  - `[:phx_media_library, :conversion, :start | :stop | :exception]` — image conversion processing
  - `[:phx_media_library, :storage, :start | :stop | :exception]` — storage adapter operations (put/get/delete/exists?)
  - `[:phx_media_library, :batch, :start | :stop | :exception]` — batch operations (clear, reorder)
  - `[:phx_media_library, :reorder]` — standalone event after successful reorder
  - All spans include `duration` in stop measurements and debug-level Logger output
- **`Telemetry.event/3`** — Standalone event emitter for one-shot notifications (e.g. `:media_reordered`)
- **`:max_size` collection option** — Maximum file size in bytes. Validated before storage (not after). Returns `{:error, {:file_too_large, actual_size, max_size}}`. Automatically derived into LiveView upload's `:max_file_size` via `allow_media_upload/3`
- **`:verify_content_type` collection option** — When `true` (default), verifies that file content matches its declared MIME type. Set to `false` to skip verification for collections that accept arbitrary content
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.MimeDetector` behaviour** — Pluggable content-based MIME type detection. Configurable via `:mime_detector` application env
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.MimeDetector.Default`** — Built-in magic-bytes detector supporting 50+ file formats:
  - Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, ICO, AVIF, HEIC/HEIF, SVG
  - Documents: PDF, RTF, Microsoft Office (legacy compound binary)
  - Audio: MP3 (ID3v2 + frame sync), OGG, FLAC, WAV, AIFF, AAC, MIDI, M4A
  - Video: MP4/M4V (ftyp brand detection for isom/iso2/mp41/mp42/dash/qt/3gp/3g2), AVI, MKV/WebM, FLV, QuickTime
  - Archives: ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2, 7-Zip, RAR, XZ, TAR (ustar at offset 257), Zstandard
  - Other: WASM, SQLite, ELF, Mach-O (32/64-bit, both endiannesses), PE (EXE/DLL), XML
- **`MimeDetector.detect_with_fallback/2`** — Detects from content, falls back to extension via `MIME.from_path/1`
- **`MimeDetector.verify/3`** — Compares detected content type against declared type. Returns `:ok` or `{:error, {:content_type_mismatch, detected, declared}}`
- **Content-based MIME detection in upload pipeline** — `MediaAdder` now reads file content once, detects MIME type from magic bytes (primary) with extension fallback, then validates against collection accepts. Catches executables disguised as images, etc.
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.reorder/3`** — Reorder media items by ID list: `PhxMediaLibrary.reorder(post, :images, [id3, id1, id2])`. Uses a single database transaction. IDs not in the collection are silently ignored. Emits `:batch` and `:reorder` Telemetry events
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.move_to/2`** — Move a single media item to a specific 1-based position: `PhxMediaLibrary.move_to(media, 1)`. Clamps to collection size. Re-numbers all siblings in the collection
- **`:telemetry` dependency** — Added `{:telemetry, "~> 1.0"}` as a required dependency

### Changed

- **`clear_collection/2` now returns `{:ok, count}`** — Previously returned `:ok`. Now uses a single `delete_all` query instead of N+1 individual deletes. Files are still deleted from storage individually before the batch DB delete. Emits `[:phx_media_library, :batch]` Telemetry events
- **`clear_media/1` now returns `{:ok, count}`** — Same batch optimization and return type change as `clear_collection/2`
- **`to_collection!/3` raises `PhxMediaLibrary.Error`** — Previously raised `RuntimeError`. Now raises a structured `PhxMediaLibrary.Error` with `:reason` set to `:add_failed` and `:metadata` containing `:collection` and `:original_error`
- **MIME type detection is now content-based** — `MediaAdder` detects MIME from file content (magic bytes) as primary, falling back to extension. Previously relied solely on file extension via `MIME.from_path/1`
- **`StorageWrapper` emits Telemetry events** — All storage operations (put/get/delete/exists?) are now wrapped in `Telemetry.span/3`, providing timing and operation metadata
- **`Conversions.process_conversion/5` emits Telemetry events** — Each individual conversion is wrapped in a `[:phx_media_library, :conversion]` span
- **`Media.delete/1` emits Telemetry events** — Wrapped in a `[:phx_media_library, :delete]` span
- **`MediaAdder.to_collection/3` emits Telemetry events** — Wrapped in a `[:phx_media_library, :add]` span with `:collection`, `:source_type`, and `:model` metadata
- **`allow_media_upload/3` derives `:max_file_size` from collection** — When a collection has `:max_size` configured, it's automatically passed as `:max_file_size` to `Phoenix.LiveView.allow_upload/3`. Falls back to 10 MB default

### Fixed

- **`clear_collection/2` was N+1** — Fetched all media, then deleted one-by-one. Now deletes files from storage, then removes all DB records in a single `delete_all` query with `Ecto.Query.exclude(:order_by)` to satisfy Ecto's `delete_all` constraints
- **`clear_media/1` was N+1** — Same fix as `clear_collection/2`
- **`MediaAdder` read file content twice** — Previously `File.read!` happened in `store_and_persist` for both storage and checksum. Now reads once in `read_and_detect_mime/1` and threads the content through the pipeline

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Milestones 1 & 2 complete** (370 tests passing: 297 unit + 17 Oban worker + 56 integration)
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.HasMedia` declarative DSL** — Schema-level configuration via `media_collections do ... end` and `media_conversions do ... end` macro blocks as an alternative to the function-based approach. Both styles are supported and can be mixed. `convert/2` alias reads naturally in DSL context. Backed by `CollectionAccumulator` and `ConversionAccumulator` compile-time attribute accumulators, injected via `__before_compile__` with `defoverridable`
- **`has_media()` macro injects polymorphic `has_many`** — Calling `has_media()` inside a schema block now injects a real `has_many :media` association using `Ecto.Schema.__has_many__/4` directly (bypassing macro-expansion timing constraints). Uses `:where` for `mediable_type` scoping and `:defaults` for auto-populating on `build`. Collection-scoped variants via `has_media(:images)` add scoped associations (e.g. `has_many :images` filtered by both `mediable_type` and `collection_name`). Enables standard `Repo.preload(post, [:media, :images, :documents, :avatar])`
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.media_query/2`** — Composable `Ecto.Query` builder for a model's media, optionally filtered by collection. Supports further composition with `where/3`, `limit/2`, etc.
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.verify_integrity/1`** — Delegates to `Media.verify_integrity/1` to verify a stored file's checksum against the database record. Returns `:ok`, `{:error, :checksum_mismatch}`, or `{:error, :no_checksum}`
- **`Media.compute_checksum/2`** — Computes SHA-256, SHA-1, or MD5 checksums for binary content. Used during upload and integrity verification
- **Checksum fields on `Media` schema** — `checksum` (string) and `checksum_algorithm` (string, default `"sha256"`) fields. SHA-256 computed automatically during `MediaAdder.store_and_persist/4` before file is written to storage. Migration `20240101000002_add_checksum_to_media.exs` adds columns and index
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.ImageProcessor.Null`** — No-op image processor for when no image processing library is installed. All operations return `{:error, {:no_image_processor, message}}` with a clear message guiding the developer to install `:image`
- **`Config.image_processor/0` auto-detection** — Defaults to `ImageProcessor.Image` when `:image` is available, falls back to `ImageProcessor.Null` otherwise
- **Polymorphic type derivation from Ecto table name** — `__media_type__/0` now defaults to `__schema__(:source)` (e.g. `"posts"`, `"blog_categories"`). Override via `use PhxMediaLibrary.HasMedia, media_type: "custom"` or by defining `def __media_type__, do: "custom"`. Replaces the broken naive pluralization (`"categorys"`)
- **Oban worker resolves full Conversion definitions** — `Workers.ProcessConversions` now stores `mediable_type` in job args, discovers the originating schema module via `find_model_module/1` (with `persistent_term` cache), retrieves full `Conversion` structs from the model's `get_media_conversions/1`, and filters by requested names. Handles legacy job args gracefully
- **`Config.disk_config/1` safe string-to-atom resolution** — No longer uses `String.to_existing_atom/1` which crashes on unknown atoms. Now iterates configured disk keys and compares strings
- **`PathGenerator.full_path/2` uses `Code.ensure_loaded/1` + `function_exported?/3`** — Replaces fragile `Keyword.keys(__info__(:functions))` pattern for checking optional `path/2` callback
- **56 integration tests against real Postgres** — Full lifecycle tests in `test/phx_media_library/integration_test.exs` using `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox`. Tagged with `@moduletag :db` and auto-excluded when Postgres is unavailable. Covers: add→store→retrieve→delete, collection MIME validation, single_file replacement, max_files enforcement, ordering, checksum integrity and tamper detection, polymorphic type scoping, `has_many` preloading, `media_query/2` composability, clear/delete operations, error paths, disk and memory storage adapters, concurrent access, JSON field round-trips, and unique UUID constraints
- **Test infrastructure** — `test_helper.exs` starts `TestRepo`, runs migrations programmatically, configures SQL Sandbox. `DataCase` module provides sandbox setup and `errors_on/1` helper. `NoOpProcessor` suppresses background task noise in integration tests
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.Components`** — Ready-to-use Phoenix LiveView function components for media uploads and galleries
  - `<.media_upload>` — Drop-in upload zone with drag-and-drop, live image previews, progress bars, per-entry error display, and cancel buttons. Supports full-size and compact layouts, dark mode, and full slot/attr customization
  - `<.media_gallery>` — Stream-powered gallery grid for displaying existing media with delete-on-hover, image thumbnails, document type icons, configurable columns (2–6), and `:item`/`:empty` slots for custom rendering
  - `<.media_upload_button>` — Compact inline upload button for embedding within forms or tight layouts
  - Colocated `.MediaDropZone` JS hook for enhanced drag-and-drop visual feedback (drag enter/leave tracking, drop flash animation)
  - File type icon mapping (video, audio, PDF, spreadsheet, archive, etc.)
- **`PhxMediaLibrary.LiveUpload`** — `use`-able helper module that imports upload lifecycle functions into any LiveView
  - `allow_media_upload/3` — Wraps `Phoenix.LiveView.allow_upload/3` with collection-aware defaults: auto-derives `:accept` from collection MIME types, `:max_entries` from `single_file`/`max_files`, and `:max_file_size` (default 10 MB)
  - `consume_media/5` — Wraps `consume_uploaded_entries/3` and persists each entry via `PhxMediaLibrary.add/2 |> to_collection/2`
  - `stream_existing_media/4` — Loads existing media for a model/collection into a LiveView stream with `"media-"` prefixed DOM IDs
  - `stream_media_items/3` — Inserts newly created media items into an existing stream
  - `delete_media_by_id/2` — Fetches and deletes a media record by ID (files + DB)
  - `media_upload_errors/1`, `media_entry_errors/2` — Translates Phoenix upload error atoms into human-readable strings
  - `has_upload_entries?/1`, `image_entry?/1` — Introspection helpers for conditional UI rendering
  - `translate_upload_error/1` — Extensible error translation with coverage of all built-in Phoenix upload errors
- **Media lifecycle event notifications** — `consume_media/5` and `delete_media_by_id/2` accept a `:notify` option (a pid). When set, sends `{:media_added, media_items}`, `{:media_error, reason}`, or `{:media_removed, media}` to the target process, enabling parent LiveViews to react via `handle_info/2`
- **17 Oban worker tests** — Dedicated test suite in `test/phx_media_library/workers/process_conversions_test.exs` using `Oban.Testing.perform_job/3`. Covers: missing media discard, full conversion resolution from model definitions (with dimensions/quality/fit), collection-scoped conversions, legacy job args fallback, unknown mediable_type fallback to name-only conversions, model module discovery and `persistent_term` caching, explicit model registry, and job changeset construction
- **`mix phx_media_library.regenerate` model module discovery** — The regenerate task now uses `ProcessConversions.find_model_module/1` to resolve the model module from `mediable_type`, enabling it to retrieve full conversion definitions instead of returning an empty list
- **Dialyzer ignore file** — `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` suppresses known false positives for `Mix.shell/0`, `Mix.Task.run/1`, and `Mix.Task` callback info across all mix tasks (`:mix` is not in the production PLT)

### Changed

- **`:image` dependency is now optional** — Marked `optional: true` in `mix.exs`. `ImageProcessor.Image` module is wrapped in `if Code.ensure_loaded?(Image)` and only compiled when `:image` is available. Library works for file storage without libvips installed
- **`max_files` collection cleanup now keeps newest items** — Previously `Enum.drop(max)` on ascending-ordered list incorrectly deleted the newest item. Now correctly keeps the newest `max` items and deletes the oldest excess
- **`delete_media_by_id/1` → `delete_media_by_id/2`** — Now accepts an optional keyword list with `:notify` option. The 1-arity form still works (defaults to no notification)
- **`mix precommit` alias runs tests in correct environment** — Uses `cmd --cd . sh -c 'MIX_ENV=test mix test'` instead of bare `"test"` which failed with an environment mismatch error
- **Credo --strict passes clean** — Refactored 13 functions across 9 files to resolve all nesting-depth and cyclomatic-complexity violations. Extracted helpers in `Config`, `Conversions`, `ResponsiveImages`, `ImageProcessor.Image`, `HasMedia.__before_compile__`, `Workers.ProcessConversions`, and all mix tasks. Replaced TODO tag with descriptive comment
- **Dialyzer passes clean** — Added `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` for known Mix PLT false positives. Fixed dead-code pattern in `mix phx_media_library.regenerate` (`get_model_module/1` now resolves modules instead of always returning `nil`)

### Fixed

- **`max_files` enforcement deleted wrong items** — `maybe_cleanup_collection` in `MediaAdder` used `Enum.drop(max)` which removed the newest uploads instead of the oldest. Now uses `Enum.take(excess_count)` to delete the oldest excess items, keeping the `max` most recent
- **`Config.disk_config/1` crash on string disk names** — `String.to_existing_atom/1` crashed when the atom hadn't been referenced yet. Now iterates configured disk keys and matches by string comparison
- **`PathGenerator.full_path/2` fragile function check** — Replaced `Keyword.keys(__info__(:functions))` with `Code.ensure_loaded/1` + `function_exported?/3` for robust optional callback detection
- **Polymorphic type derivation was naive** — `get_mediable_type/1` appended "s" to module name (producing `"categorys"` for `Category`). Now derives from Ecto table name (`__schema__(:source)`) with configurable overrides
- **Oban worker created empty Conversion structs** — Worker only serialized conversion names, losing dimensions/quality/format. Now stores `mediable_type` in job args, discovers the model module, and retrieves full `Conversion` definitions
- **`has_media()` macro was a no-op** — Did not inject any Ecto association. Now injects a polymorphic `has_many` via `Ecto.Schema.__has_many__/4` with `:where` and `:defaults` for proper scoping
- **Credo alias ordering** — Fixed alphabetical ordering of alias groups in `PathGenerator`, `UrlGenerator`, `AsyncProcessor`, `ResponsiveImages`, `Components`, `Fixtures`, and `PathGeneratorTest`
- **`ImageProcessor.Image.save/3` simplified** — Extracted `write_opts_for_format/2` to eliminate nested `case` inside `save/3`, reducing cyclomatic complexity
- **`ImageProcessor.Image.maybe_resize/2` flattened** — Replaced nested `case` on fit mode with multiple function clauses for `:crop`, `:contain`/`:cover`/`:fill`, and default
- **`Config.disk_config/1` simplified** — Extracted `resolve_disk_key/2` and `lookup_disk/2` to reduce cyclomatic complexity from 11 to under 9
- **`HasMedia.__before_compile__/1` decomposed** — Extracted `build_media_type_def/2`, `build_helpers/0`, and `build_dsl_defs/4` private functions to reduce nesting depth
- **`Workers.ProcessConversions.resolve_conversions/3` flattened** — Extracted `get_model_conversions/2` helper to eliminate nested `if`/`function_exported?` checks
- **Mix task refactoring** — `clean.ex`: extracted `report_orphaned_files/3`, `delete_or_report_file/3`, `find_orphaned_records/2`, `report_orphaned_records/3`, `delete_or_report_record/3`. `regenerate.ex`: extracted `conversions_for_media/2`, `run_or_report/4`, `do_regenerate/4`; used `Enum.map_join/3` instead of `Enum.map/2 |> Enum.join/2`. `regenerate_responsive.ex`: extracted `build_responsive_query/2`, `process_item/4`, `update_responsive_images/3`
- **`ResponsiveImages.generate/2` decomposed** — Extracted `generate_variants/7`, `build_responsive_data/7`, `maybe_generate_placeholder/2` to reduce nesting depth. Extracted `generate_conversion_data/1` and `generate_single_conversion_data/2` from `generate_all/1`
